# Random Tools 
A grouping of random tools that I create over time to help myself. 


## Domains.sh
./bash/etc/hosts/domains.sh

### Purpose
Allows you to block or unblock a domain from within your /etc/hosts file. 

You can put it in your path, and make it executable so it's easy to call up (if you don't understand the consequences of this, or understand how to edit /etc/hosts *YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS* :scream: )

One of thousands of similar tools that already exists. Just a shorthand for disabling websites.

### Examples
&gt; sudo domains.sh block twitter.com

&gt; sudo domains.sh unblock twitter.com
